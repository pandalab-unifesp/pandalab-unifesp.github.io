The Protocols and Network Distributed Applications lab (**PANDA Lab**) was founded in 2024 at the [Institute of Science and Technology (ICT)](https://www.unifesp.br/campus/sjc/) of the [Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP)](https://www.unifesp.br), located in São José dos Campos (SP), with the goal of fostering and promoting research projects in the fields of Computer Networks and Distributed Systems.

Our team includes permanent faculty members, postdoctoral researchers, PhD candidates, master’s students, undergraduate students engaged in Scientific Initiation research and collaborating researchers from Brazil and around the world.

The **PANDA Lab** is supported by research funding agencies, providing scholarships for Scientific Initiation, master’s, and PhD students. These partnerships play a vital role in training highly qualified human resources in Brazil.
