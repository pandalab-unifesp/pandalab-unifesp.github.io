  abstract={The promises of multipath transport are to aggregate bandwidth, improve resource utilization, and enhance reliability. In this paper, we demonstrate that the way multipath coupled congestion control is defined today leads to a suboptimal resource utilisation when network paths are disjoint, i.e., they do not share a bottleneck link. With growing interest in standardising Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC), we have implemented the practical shared bottleneck detection (SBD) algorithm from RFC8382 in MPQUIC (MPQUIC-SBD). Through extensive experiments, we evaluate MPQUIC-SBD in the context of video streaming with various Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithms, addressing both ABR classes of rule-based and learning-based solutions. We demonstrate that MPQUIC-SBD accurately detects shared bottlenecks over 90% of the time, depending on the ABR algorithm, as the size of the video segments increases. In non-shared bottleneck scenarios, when MPQUIC-SBD detects that its QUIC subflows do not share the same network resources, it decouples their congestion windows accordingly, enabling video throughput gains of up to 37% compared to MPQUIC. These gains translate directly into improved video quality metrics, including higher bitrate, better resolution, and reduced buffering, resulting in an enhanced quality of experience for users.},

  abstract={The concept of a fully connected world in the fifth generation technology envisions the massive rollout of small and constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In such IoT environments, machine-to-machine (M2M) communications is key for allowing these devices (e.g., sensors, actuators, smart meters/monitors) to collect data toward a remote server. We address this particular scenario by building and evaluating an IoT multi-access reference architecture, with a multipath TCP (MPTCP) gateway connected to multiple cellular networks to offload M2M data traffic. Experimental results from CoAP-emulated traffic indicate that the our proposed system together with the benefits of MPTCP improve IoT application performance. More specifically, multipath-based M2M data traffic offloading increases throughput and significantly reduces latency of CoAP requests as the number of sensor networks increases.},

  abstract = {Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is a promising paradigm that provides cloud computing services closer to vehicular users. In VEC, vehicles and communication infrastructures can form pools with computational resources to meet vehicular services with low-latency constraints. These resource pools are known as Vehicular Cloud (VC). The usage of VC resources requires a task scheduling process. In this case, depending on its complexity, a vehicular service can be divided into different tasks. An efficient task scheduling needs to orchestrate where and for how long such tasks will run, considering the available pools, the mobility of nodes, and the tasks deadline constraints. Thus, this article proposes an efficient VC task scheduler based on an approximation heuristic and resources prediction to select the best VC for each task, called MARINA. MARINA aims to analyze the behavior of vehicles that share their computational resources with the VC and make scheduling decisions based on the mobility (VC availability) of these vehicles. Simulation results under a realistic scenario demonstrate the efficiency of MARINA compared to existing state-of-the-art mechanisms in terms of the number of tasks scheduled, monetary cost, system latency, and Central Processing Unit (CPU) utilization.},
